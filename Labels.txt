|Use the | symbol to comment. You can make comments in separate lines - not after declaring variables
|You can change the order, names, and types of values EXCEPT: DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE ORDER OF RATING. It has to be the first one in the list
|You can include ASCII characters except "" and '' for now in variable names
|
|Allowed types of values are:
|check - produces a checkbox: âœ” for YES, empty for NO
|contint - continous number, i.e. something that can freely range from -infinity to infinity, with any value in-between. For example prices, nights the guest is staying
|contint addendum: if you want to take some sort of %, like hotel occupancy during that guest's stay, use contint
|catint - categorical value, so something within a certain range. For example allocated room number. Warning: the bigger the pool size, the more data will be required for it to become accurate
|catint addendum: for now, it has the same functionality as contint
|date - translates into day of the week (for now). Allows you to pick date form a pop-up calendar (except currently where you have to manually enter dd/mm/yyyy. Sorry)
|dropdown - offers a selection of pre-entered values, for example for the rating
|dropdown addendum I: if using dropdown, between the variable name and the variable type, inser dash-separated (-) values for the user to pick from
|dropdown addendum II: for example, for a rating, you could declare "Rating 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 dropdown" without the quotation marks (""). For now, these values must be numbers
Max rows: 7
Max columns: 13
|Max rows determines how many rows display per page
|Max columns determine how many columns fit in a single line
|You can remove these or edit the values, but DO NOT change the syntax of "Max rows: " and "Max columns: "
|If you change the values to non-numeric, bad things will happen, so don't
